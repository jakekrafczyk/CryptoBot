# CryptoBot(Kraken Exchange)

This project is largely being worked on outside of github, considering I'd rather not be advertising my trading edges. That said, I'm currently working with kernc's backtesting.py repository([Backtesting](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/)) as its object oriented and therefore better able to handle large datasets. May move on to askmike's Gekko bot([Crypto Bot](https://gekko.wizb.it/)) once I've drawn out enough insight through backtesting since it has live trading functionality.
